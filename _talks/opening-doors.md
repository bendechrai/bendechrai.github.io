Let’s connect our front door to the internet! What could possibly go wrong? Securing IoT is hard, and the last thing we want to do is let some stranger in!

Let’s take a step back and consider other ways of securing that door, and granting access remotely, without connecting your door to the internet, while adhering to common protocols and data formats throughout.

In this talk, you will learn:
* how JSON Web Tokens can be used to transmit credentials to an air-gapped device;
* how this process can still allow someone to grant remote access;
* how to apply this theory to other IoT devices; and
* how this theory can help even in IoT devices that need direct internet access.

The talk includes a live demo, featuring an actual door.
