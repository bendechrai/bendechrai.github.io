# Ben Dechrai's Web Site

Okay, so it's taken me a while to catch up, but I figured it was about time I moved to a staic site generator, especially one that allows me to host my site for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Thanks Github!

## Note to self

The command you're looking for to run this locally is:

    bundle exec jekyll serve
