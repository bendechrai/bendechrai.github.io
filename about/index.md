Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. So you want to know a bit more about me? Well, I was born at a very young age. I don't personally remember the event, but my mother (who has always been an honest person) insists that I was there.

I have worn many hats over the years! If you took those hats, boiled them down, and tried to see what the common themes are, you'd end up just staring at a pile of matted felt. It's possible I crocheted one of those hats too, which would just make me sad.

## Software Development

I've been programming computers since the age of about 5, coding basic on a [Texas Instruments TI-99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A). My first 8086-based PC was a [286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) with a 40Mb [MFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_frequency_modulation) hard drive and 2Mb of RAM! That's right folks. My dad had gone big; most people were still limited to 5Mb disks and were lucky if they have 1Mb of memory. Good times.

Believe it or not, Windows 3.0 would actually run on such a beast, and before long I was hacking the `win.ini`, `system.ini`, and `progman.ini` files to create a multi-user environment, controlled by a series of [batch scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file). Every time one of my parents closed Windows (yes, Windows ran under DOS, so there was an exit option), the aforementioned ini files would be reverted to a known good state, so I no longer had to provide desktop support to a generation that didn't notice they'd deleted the shortcut to Word from the desktop. Again.

Having found a bug in the system, I dabbled in [assembly using debug.exe](http://www.intel-assembler.it/portale/5/Write-an-assembly-program-using-DEBUG/Write-an-assembly-program-using-DEBUG.asp) to manifest my most useful creation: a binary executable that would disable CTRL-C and CTRL-BREAK. Finally, I could stop my parents from breaking out of the batch scripts.

The final piece of the puzzle fostered mostly fond memories of Turbo Pascal, which I used to create an authenticated menuing system, allowing each family member to have access to the systems they needed.

Historians believe this period of my life was the inflection point that created the privacy loving security monster in me.

## Web Development

Having commenced a software engineering course at university in 1995, I noticed a distinct lack of web development courses available. Sensing a future in this new technology (come on -- the first web browser was 6 years old already!), I took matters in to my own hands and started a web development and hosting company, [Reality42](https://reality42.net/), with my high-school friend. Kudos to him; it's still running to this day. I stepped down many moons ago.

Back then, the tech stacks available were limited and rudimentary, and I was getting quite good at [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) [VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript). ASP.NET wasn't event a sparkle in Microsoft's eye yet...

After graduating, I intended to take a 12-month gap-year and see Europe, like most good Brits. For interest's sake I contacted some recruiters via the `uk.comp.jobs.offered` [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) newsgroup. Or something like that. Yes, recruiters were on Usenet. And yes, I fell in to a job within 3 weeks of completing my uni course. And yes, I'm still trying to get the travel bug out of my system. And yes, I don't know if I ever will.

## Public Bio

Sometimes people ask me for a bio. If you're looking for one, here's an option for you:

>Ben Dechrai is a technologist with a staunch focus on security and privacy. This started at the age of 11, when he wrote software to stop his parents from breaking the family PC, and resulted in his working as a developer advocate for Auth0. He enjoys helping developers find the joy of experimentation, from ethical skulduggery to subversive automation, and can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bendechrai) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bendechrai/) at @bendechrai.
