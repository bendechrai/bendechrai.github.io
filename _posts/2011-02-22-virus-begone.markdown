I woke up this morning and wasn't in a state to go to work. Jo's feeling better, but I had a headache. I rested and took it easy and by 11.30am was feeling better, so went in to work. It's now 8.16pm and I'm going home, so still managed a full work day. Pretty awesome \*smile\*.

I believe the virus has now left the building, and we can go [inspect some property tomorrow as planned](http://365gratitude2010.blogspot.com/2011/02/feb-20th.html).

Looking forward to getting home shortly after 9pm and maybe watching some more Alias before bed.
