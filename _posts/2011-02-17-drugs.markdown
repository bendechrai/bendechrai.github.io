I gave in. I took drugs. I don't like to, but this head cold was killing me. As it is my head's still throbbing little and my nose is a tad itchy, but I don't feel like my head's in a vice.

I don't really have much more to add today. Jo and I went to see No Strings Attached, which was \*way\* better than I'd imagined possible. Highly recommended.

Now, I think I need some food. Not hungry, but I believe you're supposed to eat well when you have a cold...

See ya tomorrow.
