3rd Saturday of the month is Mornington Racecourse Market! Yay! So off we went, only to find it's a Sunday market!

That'll explain why it wasn't on last month either!

So we went to Mornington for brunch instead. Toy shopping at The Whale followed by savoury muffins, coffee and book browsing at Page 8. While Jo and Button were off in the store somewhere, I was talking to my mum about the photos on the wall. I love the effect of photographs printed on canvas; it gives the oil painting effect with the sharpness of print. The conversation reminded me that, after reviewing my [_five things_](/my-five-things/ "My Five Things") a few days ago, I was thinking of swapping my photography _thing_ for another, as I didn't seem to have the passion for it any more. I'd been waiting for a quiet day to announce that on this blog.

I've gone back on that thought though, I just need to find the time to dedicate on it. I'm fine with controlling my camera, I understand the technical aspects (not all of them, but most of what's important) to take good photos, but I'm crap at composition and seeing photo opportunities.

So I've decided I need to dedicate a day a month to go wandering specifically to take photos. Taking the camera to the market or the beach when the primary purpose is shopping or relaxing it not putting me in a place where I can concentrate on my creativity.

So with that in mind, I'm going to start using [my Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bendechrau/ "Ben Dechrai on Flickr") again, and stick a Flickr badge on this blog and start publishing the cream of my crop.
