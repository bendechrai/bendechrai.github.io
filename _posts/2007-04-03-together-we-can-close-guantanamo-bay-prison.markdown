I thought you would like to know about this new campaign to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, where President Bush is holding nearly 400 detainees without criminal charges or trials. For the first time, some of his top advisors have called for closing this affront to international law, including his own Secretary of Defense. This split inside the Administration gives us a real chance close Guantanamo forever.

This new group called Avaaz is putting together a global petition to close Guantanamo. We will run the petition in key US newspapers as soon as we have signatures from every country. [You can sign up here](http://www.avaaz.org/en/close_guantanamo).
