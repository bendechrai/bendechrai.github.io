Caught up with my mum and Jo after work today for dinner. We had a fantastic meal (and I mean fantastic, you must go!) at [Tusk Cafe Bar](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=6703294760615249828&q=Tusk+Cafe+Bar&dtab=0&sll=-37.853944,144.993079&sspn=0.006295,0.006295&ie=UTF8&ll=-37.852643,144.991773&spn=0,0&z=19) on Chapel Street in Windsor. I can wholeheartedly recommend the shared platter and lamb satay. Oh my!

So anyway, we're having dinner and a catchup before taking my mum to the airport for her to return home for a day before heading off on her trip round the world (almost).

It was absolutely wonderful having you in our space mum. Until we see each other again - real soon I hope.
