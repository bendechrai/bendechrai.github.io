![BarCampMelbourne](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/barcamp_melbourne_400_100.png)> <span class="WikiLink">BarCamp</span> is an ad-hoc un-conference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees.

I've started the [BarCampMelbourne](http://barcamp.org/BarCampMelbourne) wiki page and have been talking to George Dickeson who's doing the same for [BarCampAdelaide](http://barcamp.org/BarCampAdelaide) about running the two on the same weekend - the 3rd and 4th of March 2007. Hopefully we can get others around Australia to organise their own BarCamps at the same time and have a [BarCampAustralia](http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustralia)! If anyone is interested in helping out with the Melbourne event, please [check out the wiki page](http://barcamp.org/BarCampMelbourne) and add your name to the list. Same goes for sponsors - we need a venue, food, wireless, t-shirts, projector, and more.

If you want to start your own BarCamp and join the fun in March, create a page on the [barcamp.org](http://barcamp.org/) wiki and be sure to add a link to your page at [BarCampAustralia](http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustralia).
