According to [Crooks and Liars](http://www.crooksandliars.com/), a poll by Fox News shows [Britney Spears was voted the most foolish American](http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/04/04/fox-news-they-distort-their-own-april-fools-poll/).

The top 5 looked like this:

1. Britney Spears: 33%
2. Paris Hilton: 12%
3. Mel Gibson: 1%
4. OJ Simpson: 13%
5. Pres. George Bush: 40%

Now perhaps this is an April Fool's joke, or maybe Fox News are distorting the poll results. I cannot find the poll on [Fox News Polls](http://www.foxnews.com/polls/index.html) page. Perhaps it was pulled? And correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it Fox News that incorrectly announced Bush as president before the votes were in?
