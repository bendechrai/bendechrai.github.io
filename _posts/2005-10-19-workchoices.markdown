Sound familiar? It will if you've been following Australian politics. These words are not in response to John Howard's latest plans, however. I just read them at [ThinkSocialist](http://thinksocialist.com/wordpress/wp-trackback.php?p=15). They are in relation to Pinochet's actions after the unfortunate "suicide" of Salvador Allende.

>Pinochet also privatized the social security system of Chile, much like our very own pseudo-president \[Bush\] is seeking to do.

What happened next? Chile was lead into a fascist regime. So tell me - are you worried?
