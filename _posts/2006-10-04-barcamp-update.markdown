![BarCampMelbourne](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/barcamp_melbourne_400_100.png)Just a quick update on [BarCampMelbourne](http://barcampmelbourne.org/) - someone suggested I email [the Mayor](http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&pa=1317&pg=1995) and see if there's any chance of funding or other assistance, so I've just written him an email.

I also got a call from someone in Sydney who mentioned he might be able to secure a sponsor for us. Have to keep this a bit vague in case it falls through, but it's all looking kinda good right now.

Don't forget to add your name to the list of participants! Unless you're not coming of course...
