We woke up this morning in my bed.

We went for our morning walk.

Jo went to yoga and I had a long bath. I fell asleep.

Jo got back from yoga and we had brunch and did some crocheting.

We went to town to try on some [VIBRAM FiveFingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.it/) shoes. I like the [KSOs](http://www.vibramfivefingers.it/eng/kso.aspx).

We did some crocheting.

We headed home and bought gourmet, ready to cook pizza, soy milk, drinking chocolate and chocolate from the shops.

We got home and cooked pizza and drank wine.

We have raw, dairy-free chocolate mousse, organic milk chocolate and organic soy hot chocolate coming up for dessert soon.

A day to recompose myself.
