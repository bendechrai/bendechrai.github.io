Politicians do it; CEOs do it; Even educated MPAA officials do it; Let's do it; Let's spread the <abbr title="Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt">FUD</abbr>!

Can you spot the oxymoron?

Anyhow - [digg](http://digg.com/tech_deals/MPAA_campaign_makes_piracy_seem_totally_badass) just pointed me at [this highly amusing poster](http://mpaa.org/MPAA_Poster_22x32_FINAL.pdf) that is meant to teach kids not to upload copyrighted media.

> Q: Why shouldn't you upload copyrighted media? A: Because you risk:
> 
> - breaking the law
> - getting exposed to pornographic materials
> - downloading a serious computer virus
> - sharing your personal data, which can lead to identity theft
> 
> A "free" movie might actually cost you. It may be free, but it could be **illicit material** cna come with a **virus** as well. Some Peer-2-Peer file-sharing services could put your **family's financial records** on the screen - to be seen across the entire Internet.

Well I'm glad to know that I'm only risking breaking the law - not **actually** breaking the law. And who in their right mind keeps financial records on a computer that's linked to the Internet? Given that most people still use Windows and a lot of those still use Internet Explorer and Outlook Express, I'd be more worried about the spyware and viruses that this software combination exposes you to.

And just to be a little anal about this - why would uploading copyrighted material put you at the risk of downloading a serious computer virus? Which part of this upload process involves the download of another file. Unless they mean the peer-to-peer file sharing application, of course.

It's a slow news day for me. Need another coffee.
