We had not plans at all all weekend, except the party last night, and while we were thinking of going fruit picking in Rye, we ended up staying in. It was excellent.

Now getting this blog post out of the way so I can work on Jo's web site, which I've just discovered probably needs a rebuild already. Luckily I've not invested too much time in it yet. I think I'll do that for the next hour or so, but first, I'm going to need my almond chai latte.

Jo put it well in a Facebook post: my life choices are freakin' awesome!
