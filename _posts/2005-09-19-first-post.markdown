Well, I think from now on, I'm going to keep my on-line life restricted to a blog and a photo album (to be created). I'm trying to simplify my life. My life is in need of simplifying at the moment. A lot.

For those who don't know, I quit my job last Friday. My boss was sad to see me go, and this morning he asked if I'd still invite him up to Bogie Bush. It's been great working for him, and with my colleagues, but I need to move on. The new job is a great opportunity and challenge that I know I won't get where I am right now. There's also a pay rise, but that's not the most important bit... I get to start a project from scratch, have total ownership and technical control. I get to decide how it gets developed, in what language, with what guidelines, using my object model... I don't think I'm alone in saying that's what most developers would like...

For those who don't know me, you'll find I like my ellipsis'...!

I'll leave it at this for now... more to come soon.
