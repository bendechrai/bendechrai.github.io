I got up at 6am. Hmm, 6.30. I was supposed to get up at 6am.

I got up and made breakfast for Jo, Pat and myself, while Jo organised porridge for Button and some lunch for us. I made Jo a coffee and then it was time to go. Monday morning rush! As usual.

Today was a bit different though. Button came to me 5 minutes before I needed to leave; she could sense me getting ready to go; to give me a cuddle good bye. When I was then just about to go I got another, and then after I went to get a book to read on the train and gave Pat a hug good bye, got a 3rd cuddle from Button and a second from Jo.

I walked towards the door and saw the three most important women in my life all looking back waving at me. I don't usually feel like an adult. I see myself as a much younger person, bot in appearance and mindset, but this morning was very much a clich√©d TV scene where dad leaves to go to work and his family wave him off. It was so totally surreal.

And yet at the same time so awesome to have a family energy around me in the strongest way I've felt it to date.
