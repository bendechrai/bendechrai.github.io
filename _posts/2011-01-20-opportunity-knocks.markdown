I've had so many opportunities presented to me recently, it's quite bizarre. I recently gained clarity in what it is my new business is going to provide, and it's a first of its kind. An opportunity like that doesn't come along often. Usually, we have to find a point of difference in an existing market. My point of difference is, no-one's done this before.

And opportunity knocked on Jo's door today too. I won't even begin to describe any of that, it's not my place, but she's invited me in to the inner sanctum of her opportunity, and it's a corker!

I'm grateful for the ability to spot opportunity, and moreover to seize that opportunity when it presents itself. Some years ago, I might have noticed something, but not done anything about it, or thought it was too good to be true.

I didn't realise it was an opportunity, but didn't give it a chance to materialise. It tried again, with success, on Tuesday. It was a very good proposal but it didn't fit my expectations. After negotiations, it very quickly changed to meet them. I've had similar prospects in the past, but I was never clear, with myself, what I wanted. A few weeks ago I decided what the attributes of any future prospects would be, and today I get one, meeting them exactly. That, folks, is manifestation in a nutshell. Know what you want. Be clear about what you want. Don't concentrate on what you don't want. Concern yourself with the what, not the how. Do this, and be conscious, and it will come to you. The Universe is conspiring for you to succeed.
