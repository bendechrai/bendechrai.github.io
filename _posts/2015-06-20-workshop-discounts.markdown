**Note: this is a first come, first served offer!**As I'll be in New Zealand for the PHP Conference again, I'm offering a special discount on my workshops to the Wellington and Auckland communities and organisations.

Any one-, two-, or three-day workshop running between the 5th and 7th September inclusive, won't attract a travel cost, and training fees will be discounted by 10%! For a group of 6, that's a total saving of up to NZ$1,000!

Further, if you can provide a suitable venue and catering, I'll increase the training fee discount to 20%!

The only catch? You have to find the group, choose the course, and confirm by July 17th.
