I just noticed that Telstra's web site shows excess data usage on their Data Pack 10 is $.050/Mb. Not quite sure what to make of that, I had a chat with Wendy, one of their on-line support agents:

> Wendy 42164513: How may I help with your enquiry today? Ben: Hi Wendy. I was just wondering if you could confirm the excess usage charges on the Data Pack 10 product. Your web site says $.050/MB, but I suspect it's meant to say $0.50/MB

> Wendy 42164513: .50c per meg Ben

> Ben: so that's half a cent, or 50 cents?

Tiring!
