Thanks to everyone who turned up at OSDC! I really had a great time, learnt lots, met new people, and I even had fun helping to run the whole conference. I'm absolutely exhausted, but would do it all again tomorrow if I could!

We've been encouraging people who took photos to stick them up at [flickr](http://flickr.com/) with the [tag "osdc2005"](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/osdc2005/). Yours truly can even be [seen here helping Jon Oxer perform real-time hardware modifications during a keynote talk](http://flickr.com/photos/20392752@N00/70446847/)!

Life, however, goes on, and I've been back at work for two days, we're heading to [Bogie Bush](http://bogiebush.com/) this weekend, and I'll be writing my next talk for [SecureCon](http://securecon.unimelb.edu.au/) in February 2006.
