A little late on the post - our guest has just left, and despite nodding off on the sofa while Jo and Georgia chatted away the early hours of this morning, I could have half listened for ages.

Today was mostly uninteresting up until leaving work. I finished all scheduled work by midday and then scrounged around for bits of work here and there for the rest of the day.

The evening was much more fun and started off with strawberry daiquiris and conversation, moved on to bubbly and sashimi (sound familiar?) finishing with coffee and raw chocolate mousse. It was a winner last time, as it was tonight. I'd met Georgia once before and she's a gorgeous person; open, honest, authentic and funny. She was bringing Jo up to speed on international current affairs (I think it was _Desperate Housewives_ and _The Bold and The Beautiful_) while I was looking in to Internet TV services (we don't have free to air or subscription TV here). The evening went very quickly and before we knew it it was 1am.

So on that note, I'm going to go to bed very shortly, if I can persuade my beautiful woman to join me. Else I'll just lie on the sofa and drift off to the sound of her writing her blog and laughing at videos on Facebook.
