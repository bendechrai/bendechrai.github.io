I met some new people today, some friends of Jo's that I hadn't seen before, a part of her life I hadn't entered yet. It sounds a lot more mysterious than it is...

The three of us headed to Balnarring for a pub meal that turned out to be a (s)wanky menu with wordy descriptions and few choices, so we finished out drinks and headed to a family pizza restaurant around the corner. Fantastic food and a great choice of wine (thanks babe!) only served to improve an atmosphere that couldn't fail. Six adults and almost as many children and the place was frenetic.

While they were quite different, all the souls around the table were gentle and kind; it was a beautiful energy to be a part of. Nourishment for the mind and the body. I look forward to seeing them again.
