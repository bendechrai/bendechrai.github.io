I wanted to reinstate an old blog post of mine today, and when contemplating the task of importing only one post from my previous blog, decided to just bring it all in again. Some images are missing, presumed dead, and posts will be updated accordingly in due course (read: if it doesn't happen in your life time, please assume it'll be completed not long thereafter).

I've just popped my head in on a few of them, and have been reminiscing a little. Some of them bring back memories I'm not quite ready to relive, it seems. But they're all me, all mine and all my truth, even if it was only my truth at the time of writing.

I'm off to check out a few more, while Jo finishes her blog post off.
