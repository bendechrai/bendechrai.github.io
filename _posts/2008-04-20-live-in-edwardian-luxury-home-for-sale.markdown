![Photo of 9/9 Waxman Parade, Brunswick West](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/bbf3d563-2019-460c-af7d-34e018901c2c.jpeg "9/9 Waxman Parade, Brunswick West")**<span style="color: #ff0000;">SOLD!</span>**

As my other half correctly mentioned in the comments, we've now sold this house. We did it without the use of an agent and saved ourselves an estimated AU$10,000 in commission alone.

If you're looking to sell your house with the help of an agent though, look for one that follows [Jenman](http://www.jenman.com.au/)'s principles in ethical selling. The Jake referred to in the comments is a lovely English chap working in Melbourne, Australia, for [Lewis Realty](http://www.lewisrealty.com.au/), who are one such agency.

The original post follows:

Would you like to live in a piece of Edwardian history in Brunswick West? Tall ceilings, large rooms and windows, timber floors and corridor walls, double brick, fully renovated, and even though it's a unit, you can't see into your neighbour's bathroom while you're doing the washing up!

If you have a green streak in you, it's already Moreland Council Energy Foundation star rated, has a basic grey water system in place, the brand new roof feeds into a 1,000 litre tank rigged up to water the veggie patch in the garden, has a solar hot water system that works about 80% of the year. Amongst the other herbs, fruits and vegetables, the garden has an apple and avocado tree growing, and you can see the very well established passionfruit tree enveloping the fence in the photo.

It's also got an HD antenna, space for two cars, a shed and pushbike shelter in the read garden. You get about 180sqm of land of which about 100sqm is house. Cyclists and walkers can jump onto the Moonee Pond trail at the back; there's a bus stop across the road, two tram lines (55 and 59) within 800m, Puckle St (Moonee Ponds) 2kms, and it's close to the CityLink (though you can't really hear it!).

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">We've got it listed on domain.com.au. If you're interested, drop me a line or turn up for one of the scheduled open for inspection.</span>
