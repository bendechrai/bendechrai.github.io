_Today is a two post day - this is post two._We found out this morning that it's Earth Day today because Google had a funky, interactive doodle on its homepage:

So we decided to head to the beach with bags and gloves and do some tidying up. We broke two bags and filled one big black bag with rubbish. It was actually a little depressing how little distance we had to travel to fill a bag, but it was a nice walk along the beach and, as the tide came in, powerful waves accompanied us throughout.

Today was a fantastic day, with many opportunities to reflect and be grateful for my life in all its many aspects.

Tomorrow we yoga and leave for our weekend in the big smoke. We'll have laptops and cameras, and will probably both still blog, if we can tear ourselves away from the 24/7 room service, broadway shows and camera shops :)
