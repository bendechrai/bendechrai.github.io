About 10 days ago, I got a call from a journalist for [the IT section](http://australianit.news.com.au/) of [The Australian](http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/), a national daily newspaper in (you guessed it) Australia.

The article is, so I understood, a comparative look at ASP and PHP, and the article came out today. I haven't bought it yet, but a friend just called me to tell me I'm in there!

I'll post back again once I've read the article and give my opinions.
