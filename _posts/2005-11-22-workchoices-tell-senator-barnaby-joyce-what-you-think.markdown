I just received an email from the guys at [Your Rights At Work](http://www.rightsatwork.com.au/) informing me that Senator Barnaby Joyce will be making his decision on the WorkChoices bill on the 28th. He has the power to veto this bill, as a vote of no from him will see the bill destroyed.

We have a little over 3 days to get our views to him, and I would encourage everyone who feels this bill can only be a bad thing, to [sign the petition now](http://www.rightsatwork.com.au/campaigns/takeastand) and get your personal comments to him.

Here were my comments to him:

> I read an interesting post on someone's web site (http://tinyurl.com/8zz6j) the other day. I'd like you to have a quick read. The part that drew my attention was: "Trade unions ... were abolished. Along with the unions went other gains in worker's rights including the destruction of minimum wage."
> 
> He was talking of the decline in Chile after Pinochet took control, who went on to also privatise the social security system.
> 
> I cannot for the life of me find a good reason to vote yes on the new WorkChoices bill. I've tried. I wanted to understand the governments point of view, but I just can't.
> 
> If the bill is passed, I have very grave expectations for the future of Australia.
> 
> I urge you to not pass this bill, for the sake of all Australians.
> 
> With respect, Ben Balbo
