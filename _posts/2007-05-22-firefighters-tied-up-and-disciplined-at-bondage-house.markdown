A spokesman for the Melbourne Fire Brigade commented on a fire at a bondage and discipline parlour in inner Melbourne that was under control in under 30 minutes:

> "\[firefighters\] were tied up for some time but disciplined and controlled firefighting contained the blaze to one room on the second floor" <cite>[The Age](http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/occupants-flee-bondage-parlour-blaze/2007/05/23/1179601444353.html)</cite>

A spokesman with a sense of humour!
