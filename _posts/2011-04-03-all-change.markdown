My life has been taken over by a crochet hook. I sit down for a second and realise a few moments later tat I have a jellyfish in my hand.

Tonight, I even got to the point where I was wishing this project was over with, so I think it's time to down tools and get something different happening. I'll finish what I'm working on and then concentrate on a different [_five thing_](/my-five-things/ "My Five Things") for a while. Probably a business - they've been neglected for a while.
