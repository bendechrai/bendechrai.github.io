There was no way we were going to get to Daylesford for 10 am today, let's face it. It's a 2 hours drive, the Pride March was only on for an hour and a half, probably less, so we'd have to \*leave\* the house at 8am. On a Sunday. Not a chance.

7.50am, Jo comes in my room and says she still wants to go. Let's do it, I say. And so, within 30 minutes, Mum, Jo and I are showered, Button's fed, bag's packed, cat's fed and we're on the road. 10.20am we arrive, walk up the hill to see the motorcade make a pass, followed by two more full circuits. We see all the flamboyance, the pink boas, Dykes on Bikes, Line Dancers, and even a Uniting Care van supporting LGBT rights. It was awesome, it lasted 30 minutes, and it was so worth it.

We wandered off to look at [Daylesford's fantastic bookshop](http://www.paradisebooks.com.au/index.html) and bumped in to friends local to the area, so went for coffee and breakfast first. After the frenetic morning, local knowledge led us to a quiet garden behind a cafe. We lazed a couple of hours away before heading back out to do the tourist shopping spree and eventually heading home for a cup of tea. And I finished my seahorse, whom Button helped name Sea Rocker.
