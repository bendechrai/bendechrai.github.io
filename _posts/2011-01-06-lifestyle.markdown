[![](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/day3_food-300x199.jpg "Dinner on the Beach")](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/day3_food.jpg)This one's more of a gratitude thing, but if you like, I can tie it into manifestation quite easily. I just love that I can come home from work, pack a picnic basket (okay, so Jo packed it \*smile\*) and walk to the beach, eat a fantastic meal, watch the sun set over the water filled horizon, have a nap, get ants in my dreads and walk home again. What a fantastic place I live in. The whole manifestation thing ties in to me always wanting to live by the beach. And I pretty much have for most of the last 2.5 years. I'm only now starting to be able to make use of that though.
