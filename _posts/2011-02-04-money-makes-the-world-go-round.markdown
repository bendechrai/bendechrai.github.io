Today I woke up, decided not to go to work, told work I'd work from home, got a call from work telling me to rest and get better, slept, watched the end of a movie I started a night or two ago (can't remember which one, probably cos I was half asleep), slept some more, checked Facebook, emailed Jo on and off.

The body has a really good way of telling you when to stop. The trick is listening and acting on that message.

Today I did.

Now what else can I talk about while I have your attention?

Martin sent me this link a few days ago and it's fascinating. From what I understand, as a US citizen (if you're not, try to imagine you are), your taxes are collected by an organisation (IRS) that is owned by the people that own the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve in turn is a private bank that owns the US Mint which prints money that it lends to the US Government at interest. The interest is paid for by your taxes. So your taxes don't go to the government. They go to pay interest on loans the Government take out in order to pay for things for your country.

You take out a loan for your house from a bank that doesn't have the money to lend you so borrows it from the Federal Reserve at interest. So when you pay .25% above base rate (or whatever) your bank is only getting .25% - the rest goes to the Federal Reserve.

The country doesn't have the gold required to back the money it has been lent by the Federal Reserve. If everyone decided to sell up and cash out, there wouldn't be the cash to go around. So in order to make sure that doesn't happen, you are encouraged to take up more debt. The more debt you have, the more money the Federal Reserve makes and the harder it is for you to sell up and cash out.

I'm thankful that I live in a country where the Reserve Bank is accountable to the Government and the Mint is a Commonwealth Government Entity.
