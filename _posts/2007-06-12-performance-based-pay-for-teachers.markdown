With the raging success of performance-based pay for teachers in America, Australia's Federal Education Minister, Julie Bishop, today announced that a trial for the same will start in 2009.

The proof of the success of this method of paying teachers is evidenced by the fact that teachers in America have been said to give students some answers to exam questions in order to improve their performance and ensure job security and a good salary.

When will governments learn that the best way to improve the standard of education is to pay teachers a fair wage and encourage them to stay in the profession rather than make their lives even harder through red tape and administrative tasks? Or perhaps the Australian government is actively trying to destroy the public education system in order to enhance the value of private schools and justify the exorbitant government grants they receive.

**Update**

Just saw [a related article in The Age](http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/teacher-bonus-trial-next-year/2007/06/11/1181414218913.html) which points to the [Center for Teaching Quality web site](http://www.teachingquality.org/), which hosts the 50 page PDF document describing the "Performance-Pay for teachers" plan. I haven't read it in whole, but it's interesting to note they look to Singapore as a reference of a successful implementation. They openly admit that

> Singapore's public education system equitably funds its schools, and well-prepared teachers have the resources and technology needed to help their students reach world-class standards.

Doesn't it then stand to reason that this scheme will fail (as it did in 1920's, 50's and 80's) again unless our education system mirrors that in Singapore even slightly?
