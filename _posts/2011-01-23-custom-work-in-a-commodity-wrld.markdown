We went to the Mornington Market today and saw some awesome cast iron glass/bottle holders (and some that would hold your fishing rod too!), but none quite right for us. The closest was one with a spike (for the beach) and space for two glasses and two bottles, but we have 3 people and don't need a bottle holder.

In a commodity world, where everything we own, buy, are subjected to, has been homogenised by the consumer product architects to be easily, cheaply and mass produced, I am very grateful for the ability to be able to talk directly to the manufacturer of quality products and have something created the way it works best for me, not his production line.

And all of this for the princely sum of $23.
