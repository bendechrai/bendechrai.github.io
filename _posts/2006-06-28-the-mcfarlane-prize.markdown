> Named in memory of noted Australian web pioneer Nigel McFarlane, the inaugural McFarlane Prize, aims to recognize and encourage excellence in web design by Australian web developers.

I only met him once at the 2004 Open Source Developers' Conference, and from that brief encounter and hearing what other have to say about him, I think this is a great tribute. Nominations end on August 31st, and only sites that have been launched or significantly upgraded between August 1st 2005 and July 31st 2006 are eligible. I guess I'll have to wait until next year...
