![](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/day5-300x138.jpg "Day 5")I managed to work on two of [my five things](/my-five-things/) today. I hacked away at all the sticks and plants and weeds and crap in the aviary - still need to pull down the interior door and open the whole thing out. Jo did some gardening and it's all starting to look quite fantastic. I also did more work on my business and started on finalising the accounts for MooBox after submitting a voluntary deregistration form to ASIC.

The best part of today though was playing with Goose. I read her a gazillion stories just before lunch, played with the dragons and sea animals she got from the toy library this morning, played with the unicorns, did some more magic coin trickery and finally went sailing in a hammock to find islands of lost treasure.
