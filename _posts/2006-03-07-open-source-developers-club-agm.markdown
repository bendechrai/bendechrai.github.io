This will be our third year, and we are now in a position to consolidate the gains of the last two conferences, and put on our best conference yet.

We are delighted with the increased international awareness of the OSDC movement, now that OSDC Israel is underway and OSDC::Taiwan is planned for April this year.

Everyone is welcome to the AGM. This is a grass roots effort and we need all the help we can get.
