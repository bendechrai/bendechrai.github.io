The first course has been scheduled for the 27th of March, a little later than hoped. It's entitled [PHP101](http://phptraining.com.au/courses/php101/) and is ideal for those who are new to PHP but have a good understanding of at least one other programming language, such as C, Java, ASP or ASP.NET.

[Register your interest using the contact form](http://phptraining.com.au/contact/). Pay before the 27th of February to be eligible for the [early bird prize](http://phptraining.com.au/special-offers/)!
