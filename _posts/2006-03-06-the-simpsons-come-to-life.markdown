A bizarre little movie is making its rounds - the [Simpsons' intro played out with real actors](http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2004580002-2006100428,00.html).

The actors, apparently chosen because they can be easily identified with, finally settle on their couch to watch the cartoon version of the show.

Personally, I can't see that little boy looking evil, cackling maniacally or burning ants under a magnifying glass...
