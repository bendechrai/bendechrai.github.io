So, I'm going to be in Montréal, and I'm looking for tips. What should I do there? Where should I eat? Who should I meet?

A little birdy gave me a few eating tips: [Schwartz's](http://www.schwartzsdeli.com/index_eng.html), [Beauty's](http://travelchannel.igougo.com/planning/journalEntryDining.asp?JournalID=32747&EntryID=20176&n=Beauty's), and some others I can't remember. Found another site that has links to [other eateries in Montréal](http://www.ivebeenthere.co.uk/places/canada/montreal/tips/eating).

I'm also interested in meeting up with people from open source/PHP/developer types to those that just want to meet up for a coffee/beer. I'm hoping [BarCampMoncton](http://barcampmoncton.pbwiki.com/) will be held while I'm there. I'd like to go to some user groups while I'm there. Do you live in Montréal, or know someone who does? So, any ideas or suggestions?
