> PHP Training Australia launches its website, just minutes after launching its first clients site.

Yes folks, the wheels are moving. We've designed a few modules and are about ready to give our first course. There's probably another week's work to do, and then we'll announce the first course date, hopefully to be mid to end February.

Check out the [PHP Training Australia web site](http://phptraining.com.au/). A subscription system will be available soon to be kept up-to-date on new courses and events.
