Jo's been working really hard on her business. I've been spending most waking moments not spent at work, on the laptop working on the technical side of her business, and while we've spent a lot of time in each other's presence, we've still missed each other.

So today we made it all about us. We went for a drive, made an impromptu stop at a market we passed (and I devoured a totally delicious, fresh, hot jam doughnut!), went for fish and chips and beer (just what both of us were craving, and it hit the spot!) followed by a game of pool and two of ten pin bowling. Awesome fun!

How often do you stop and take a breather?
