I just have to say this while I'm feeling it. I just watched [Code 46](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345061/) and I have to say it's the most beautiful film I've seen in a long time. I never cry when I watch movies - but I did this time. It made me angry. So angry I nearly crushed my wine glass. So angry I wanted to take revenge against the world. Then a tear ran down my cheek. I haven't felt a tear run down my cheek for a long time. Usually when I cry I just hold it in and my body shakes. No tears. This moved me. When I felt that tear, I felt elated. I felt happy. I felt real again. I felt happy to feel sad. I felt alive.
