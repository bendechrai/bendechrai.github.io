The US Dept of Homeland Security might be given the responsibility of ensuring the Internet doesn't break. Or something like that.

[This article](http://www.homelandstupidity.us/2006/06/28/who-restarts-the-internet-after-a-cyber-katrina/) describes how an overseas attacker could send the US into an economic and security crisis, and that someone needs to be responsible for "restart\[ing\] and restor\[ing\] the Internet" \[John J. Castellani, president of Business Roundtable\].

Gosh - I know some people don't know how the Internet works, but you'd imagine someone would have given the DHS and John J. Castellani a quick lesson before they made a fool of themselves.

Of course, it's probably not about security, just about economy - the economy of the Government coffers. People hate stealth taxes, so why not disguise it as "yet another counter-terrorism measure"?
