I wrote an article on [Installing PHP 5.3](http://phpmelb.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69:installing-php-53&Itemid=1) in order to look at the newest features that have been back-ported from PHP 6. The result of this is my [What's new in PHP 5.3](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/whats-new-php-5-3) article that was published by [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/) yesterday.

I won't go in to the nitty-gritty here, but suffice it to say the the new features will solve a number of problems. [Read the full article](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/whats-new-php-5-3) to find out more about namespaces, late static binding, a new MySQL native driver and the other features of PHP 5.3.
