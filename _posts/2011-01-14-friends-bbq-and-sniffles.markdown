Another friends post. Alvin, Marty and Rick came round for a BBQ tonight. We'd also planned to watch a movie, but settled with some Bro Town instead. Awesome. Thanks for an awesome night guys!

I'd had the sniffles since waking up and was steadily getting worse, and by the time everyone left at 1.20am, I just went straight to bed.

Thanks to Jo for loving her camera so much that I have photos of my moments of gratitude too!
