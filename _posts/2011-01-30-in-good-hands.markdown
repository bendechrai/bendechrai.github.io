I went for a post-op check-up this morning and all was well. Jo was shown the after care requirements and we left after grabbing a photo opportunity with the surgeon and returned to the hotel. Jo cooked breakfast and I rested as much as possible while playing with Button. We had some friends arrive for lunch before our initial expected departure, and they all had tremendous fun in the pool, we had a BBQ, drank some bubbly, while I rested up. Unfortunately I couldn't go in the water due to my healing wounds.

He wasn't concerned and recommended monitoring it and not flying if the symptoms didn't alleviate themselves within a couple of hours. We've booked new flights for tomorrow.

It was also our one year anniversary, or rather the last day of our four day period we call our anniversary. Happy anniversary Jo. I love you fuck loads. And thanks for looking after me this weekend!
