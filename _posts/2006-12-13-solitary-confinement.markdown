Wow - it's almost two weeks since my last post. While that's not too unusual for me, I was hoping to be a bit more active while in Canada. A lot has happened...

We went to [Saint-Donat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Donat,_Quebec), a small village north of Montreal, the weekend before last and stayed with friends who own a chalet up there. This was the weekend of the big ice storms in Montreal. I had my first [poutine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine) on the Saturday night, and it was delicious!

The week days since my last post have been spent in near solitary confinement, and I have to admit it's starting to affect me a little. We're staying in one of UQAM's residential apartments in the centre of Montreal, and I'm working 9 to 5.30 (or thereabouts) every day. I wake up here, I have breakfast, I get to work, I have lunch (occasionally going out), get back to work, S gets home and we have dinner. Evenings are a little easier - we'll meet with friends/colleagues, go to a pub, we even went to see the Elvis Story at the theatre last Saturday. But in general, I think I'm going slightly nuts. More nuts that usual. I can't wait to work from the office again (after some proper holiday, of course!).

But back to happier subjects, we've been trying the [suggested eateries](https://bendechrai.com/2006/11/03/alors-quest-ce-que-je-peux-faire-a-montreal/) and l'Etranger was great. It looked like a road-side diner, but the menu was awesome. Took about 10 minutes to read the thing! We both went for the soup of the day (broccoli), I had a Yo Lurvely!

My French is improving mildly too. I went to visit a friend's office last Friday and on the way back to the Metro, started talking to a born-in-Montrealian who's never left the country, but aspires to some day. While the conversations were simple and basic, we managed to converse in excellent Frenglish (franglais en fran√ßais!).

My confinement will be temporarily lifted tomorrow, as S and I will be going to Ottawa for two days. I will probably take the laptop and work on the bus (2.5 hours each way) to keep on track, and will probably end up working a few of my official holiday dates to make sure I've actually done three weeks of work during my stay here. The end is now in sight - the 19th is my first day of holiday, and I'll probably work that day to catch up and then I'm free until the end of January :-) (Note to boss - not that I don't enjoy my job!)

Well, S should be here any minute for lunch, so (there's the knock at the door!) so I'll sign off for now and try to be more active before leaving for Guatemala.
