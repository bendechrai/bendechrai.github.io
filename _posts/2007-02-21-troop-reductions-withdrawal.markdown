I just heard our esteemed minister for foreign affairs, The Hon. [Alexander Downer](http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/), MP, say that Tony Blair is not withdrawing his troops, he's reducing the number...

I'm sorry he got cut off (it was only a news preview), because I'm so sure the rest of his sentence would have made sense!! Not!
