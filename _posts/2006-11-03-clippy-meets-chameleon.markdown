I don't think Microsoft have a mascot, do they? Maybe Ballmer (or a chair).

Anyway, I almost fainted. Well, not really, but I did check to see if it's April 1.

> Microsoft will offer sales support for Suse Linux and also co-develop technologies with Novell to make it easier for users to run both Suse Linux and Microsoft Windows on their computers. Microsoft also will agree not to assert rights over patents to any software technology that might be incorporated into Suse Linux.

So, if SUSE uses a technology that Microsoft has a patent for, and this "thing" is released open source, does that mean Microsoft can't assert their rights when it's used in another Linux distribution? And does this mean Microsoft are scared or clever?

Looks like Microsoft might be trying to change that last one to "then they join you"
