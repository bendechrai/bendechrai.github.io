I know I haven't written for a while, and I apologise (especially to my mother who is still waiting for news from our trip in Guatemala). I will get there!

Most recently, as well as settling back into a relatively new job, The [BarCampMelbourne](http://barcampmelbourne.org/) organisers have been working hard to find a venue and secure Internet access. These are both pretty much settled now, pending a few signatures.

The next step is to secure sponsorship so we can afford to actually run the event.

I'm really happy to say the Scott Davey of [Datalink](http://datalink.com.au/) (a previous employer of mine) has agreed to sponsor the event. Thanks Scott!

[![Datalink](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/datalink.png)](http://datalink.com.au/)As I've told friends, and mentioned on the [BarCampMelbourne](http://barcampmelbourne.org/) web site, [Datalink](http://datalink.com.au/) are a great bunch of people who really know their stuff (an no, I'm not hyping it because they're sending me some money!). Rarely have I been challenged so much in my day job and worked with people who consistently think out side the box to come up with their solutions. I take solace from the fact that I manage to go for a bike ride with Scott every now and then, and see him and his partner for dinner once in a blue moon...

Do you know anyone who might be interested in sponsoring [BarCampMelbourne](http://barcampmelbourne.org/)? For full details, check out the [Sponsorship ](http://barcamp.org/BarCampMelbourne2007Sponsorship)page and [get in touch with me directly](mailto:ben@benbalbo.com) if you're interested.
