A friend in Queensland posted this on Facebook today: Today has been full of Magic. Seems Magick has found its way to Victoria too, with today marking closure of a number of things that have been hanging around. And now that the doors have closed, I see the open ones that have until now appeared to be beyond my grasp.

Of course, they haven't been unattainable; I allowed myself to believe they were.

The beautiful thing about Magick, as with love, is that it is infinite, and all we need to do is allow it to enter us; to feel worthy of it.
