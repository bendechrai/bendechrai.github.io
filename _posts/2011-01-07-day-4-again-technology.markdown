[![](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/day4b-300x138.jpg "Banana and Berry Ice Cream")](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/day4b.jpg)A quick one, cos I've already posted once today, but after a sweltering Melbourne day, I love technology. Our fantastic [Thermomix](http://thermomix.com/) allowed me to whip up a banana and berry ice cream in about 2 minutes. Including peeling the bananas, serving and cleaning up.
