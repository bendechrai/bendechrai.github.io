Burlesque soundtrack playing at full whack. Bottle of red polished off. Two more episodes of Alias season 2 down. Desperate Housewives episode 7 ready and prepped. Blog writing begins.

How fucking awesome is Alias at the moment? I mean our moment? [Season two episode ten](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Alias_%28season_2%29#ep32 "Wikipedia: Alias Season 2 Episode 10"). I don't know if it's Nelson McCormick's directing or if Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have decided to throw more jokes in, or perhaps the show is just finding its feet and venturing in new directions, away from the standard spy type TV series, but I thoroughly enjoyed this episode, with raucous laughter coming from the two of us at regular intervals. Marshall goes on his first field mission and is so endearingly raw and nervous, while also being in awe of Sydney's capabilities as a spy. As a fellow geek, albeit much less hardcore, I feel for him throughout this episode. He has a beautiful character that entices you both enjoy his adventure and feel his anxiety. Kevin Weisman does a brilliant job in this character.

Can I just add, I love that we can play music this loud without annoying the neighbours. I hope we're not annoying the neighbours. Can I also say, as someone who owns Marilyn's album, I much prefer [Cher & Christina Aguilera's rendition of Beautiful People](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Beautiful+People+Cher+%26+Christina+Aguilera). Seriously. I _love_ Marilyn's version, still to this day, despite not being in to the metal/hardcore scene any more (he's so much more varied than that to be fair), but listen to the current remix.

I've just started reading [Think & Grow Rich](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Think_and_Grow_Rich) recently, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I love the oldish English he uses in the 1960s, I cringe at the patriarchal bent to his writings, but I am grateful for the fact that I read his words and agree with what he says. I have, after all, been reading, sharing and living this philosophy for a while, and he writes, predominantly I believe, for those who are not familiar with the process of manifestation and affirmation. The instructions in his book encourage the reader to overcome the instinct to mistrust and second guess his words. I strongly recommend this book to anyone, whether you're well versed in the practices and methods of the wealthy or not. I found, in particular, this poem (page 56) inspiring:

>
#### **Thinking**
> 
> If you think you are beaten, you are If you think you dare not, you don't, If you like to win, but you think you can't It is almost certain you won't. If you think you'll lose, you're lost For out of the world we find, Success begins with a fellow's will It's all in the state of mind.
> 
> If you think you are outclassed, you are You've got to think high to rise, You've got to be sure of yourself before You can ever win a prize.
> 
> Life's battles don't always go To the stronger or faster man, But soon or late the man who wins Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!
> 
> \- Walter D. Wintle - 1905

Finally, when I checked the mail tonight, I found this: [![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2011-02-14-1024x530.jpg "Amex says thanks")](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2011-02-14.jpg)

Apparently they are grateful that I used my American Express Card. Because I ordered one for another purpose? Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the $50 gift card, and the effect of this on me, versus the cost to them, is a marketing win for them (hell, this post, while not an outright recommendation is probably worth that $50 to them). I think we can all learn something from this. Jo and I share a philosophy that our tenants are our best assets, and they need to be respected and treated as such. [Steve McKnight](http://www.propertyinvesting.com/) writes in his books that he rewards early rental payments with cinema vouchers. Think about it: giving back $20 a month for on-time payment is a small price to pay, and at the same time it feeds right in to the "give and you shall receive many times in return" mantras of the rich and wealthy. Amex have taken a similar tactic. In giving me $50 after we've spent $10k or more on their card, their investment (half a percent) has given me a positive image of their company. Love it.
