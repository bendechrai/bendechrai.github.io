Burma is ruled by one of the most brutal military dictatorships in the world. For decades the Burmese regime has fought off pressure--imprisoning elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and democracy activists, wiping out thousands of villages, imposing forced labour, creating refugees.

But last Tuesday Buddhist monks and nuns, revered in Burma, began marching and chanting prayers. The protests spread as hundreds of thousands of ordinary people and public figures joined in, finding the hope they'd lost. Now they're facing crackdown â€“ so please, show your solidarity to this movement towards reconciliation and democracy and [sign the emergency petition supporting the Burmese people](http://www.avaaz.org/en/stand_with_burma/tf.php?CLICK_TF_TRACK) -- it'll be delivered to United Nations Security Council members and international media all week.

In the past, Burma's military rulers have massacred the demonstrators and crushed democracy. The world must stand with the Burmese people at this time, to show the military rulers that the world will not tolerate repression and violence.

Right now, global leaders are gathering in New York for the annual United Nations summit. In speeches, press interviews but also in real actions, we need them to show Burma's military junta that the global community is willing to act in solidarity with the protesters.

Show your solidarity to this movement for peace and democracy and [sign the emergency petition supporting the Burmese people](http://www.avaaz.org/en/stand_with_burma/tf.php?CLICK_TF_TRACK). It'll be delivered to UN Security Council members and the UN press corps all week.
