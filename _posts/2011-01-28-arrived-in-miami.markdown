Arrive in the Gold Coast, got a taxi to our resort and found the room was available early at no extra fee. Sweet!

A leisurely lunch later we went for a dip and Lucy allowed me to help her learn to doggy paddle! It had been such a long day, and it was only 3pm!

We went back inside, cooked more food (Button's eating for 3 at the moment!), watched some black and white movie, lazed around, and then I went off for my 5.45pm appointment. Everything went very well, and I got back to the resort at around 7.30pm. Now chilling out for the evening. I have an early meeting tomorrow at 9.15am, and today's postponed meeting hopefully after 3pm. The rest of the time will be relaxing by the pool, cooking a barbie and drinking beer and wine.
