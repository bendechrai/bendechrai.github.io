**UPDATE: I just called the Fitzroy Police Station and it's been handed in. Thank you to everyone who shared this story and helped me try and get my laptop back. You are all rocking, beautiful people!**At about 8.45am on Monday 25th March, I left a tank bag on the side of **Brunswick Street** just outside The Black Pearl near the corner of **Johnston Street**. In it was my work **laptop**, a pair of **headphones**, some motorbike waterproofs and a few other bits and pieces.

There was also a bloody fantastic home-cooked lunch in it.

If you've found it, [please get in touch](/contact/ "Last day in Hà Nội"). There's a **$500 reward** for its safe return.

In hope and positivity,
