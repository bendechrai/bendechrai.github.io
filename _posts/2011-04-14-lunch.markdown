Despite the server changes that I wasn't aware of, documentation had become duplicated, files I couldn't access, and networking issued that stopped me sending changes from my development environment to the staging server, I had the best day at work in a long while today.

At some point after midday, I saw Marty get up. I asked him where he was going for lunch and that if it was a pub I'd like to come along.

We decided on The Union and Jimmy was also coming. I asked Tony if he'd like to join us, which he did. On the way out I told Glenn and Sam where we were going and they came long too. Aidan also joined us, as did Gil.

We had a tech only lunch for the first time in a while and it was ace. I was strange that we all fitted around one table, but it was fun and much laughing was to be had.

Thanks guys!
