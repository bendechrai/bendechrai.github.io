With baited breath, I waited for the DNS to update for the [Bourke Aboriginal Health Service](http://bahs.com.au/), and am extremely happy to report that the site has now gone live successfully, and their email still works.

No reason it shouldn't have, but after a major email outage after their last DNS update a few years ago, I'd been warned that they'd had little success and that I should proceed with extreme caution.

I received an email this morning from Judy Johnson thanking us both for our generosity to their organisation: "we all appreciated the hard work done by you both".
