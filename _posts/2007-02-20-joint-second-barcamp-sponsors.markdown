In joint second place for the race to sponsor BarCampMelbourne come two community organisations, Linux Australia and the Open Source Developers' Club.

[![Linux Australia](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/linuxaustralia.png)](http://osdc.com.au/osdclub/ "Linux Australia") [Linux Australia Inc.](http://linux.com.au/ "Linux Australia") was founded to cater specifically to the needs of the Australian Linux community. Australia has unique problems that confront those attempting to organise and coordinate user groups and other support mechanisms because of its high urbanisation and large geographic distances between populated areas. Linux Australia hopes to assist in bringing the disparate pockets of Linux support into a single forum by encouraging and facilitating communication between these groups.

Under their [Grants Scheme](http://www.linux.org.au/projects/grants), Linux Australia has kindly sponsored all four [BarCampAustralia](http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustralia) venues!

[![OSDC](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/osdc-koala1.jpg "OSDC")](http://osdc.com.au/osdclub/ "Open Source Developers' Club") The [Open Source Developers' Club](http://osdc.com.au/osdclub/ "Open Source Developers' Club") runs meetings in Melbourne every other month, and an annual [Conference](http://osdc.com.au/ "Open Source Developers' Conference"), designed for developers, by developers, covering numerous programming languages across a range of operating systems with talks from introductory pieces through to the deeply technical.

Profits from conferences are used not only to prepare for future conferences, but also to support community events, such as BarCamps.

Thanks to all our sponsors!
