One of the British national daily newspapers is asking readers "what it means to be British?"

Some of the emails are hilarious but this is one from a chap in Switzerland.

> "Being British is about driving in a German car to an Irish pub for a Belgian beer, and then traveling home, grabbing an Indian curry or a Turkish kebab on the way, to sit on Swedish furniture and watch American shows on a Japanese TV. And the most British thing of all? Suspicion of anything foreign ".
