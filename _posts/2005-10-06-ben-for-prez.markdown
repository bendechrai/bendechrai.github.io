I'm very excited to be the proud new President of the [Melbourne PHP User Group](http://melbourne.ug.php.net/)! We had a meeting tonight to vote on incorporation of the organisation, and 6 positions were filled. Congratulations to the others:

- **President**: Ben Balbo
- **Vice-president**: Ted Bown
- **Secretary**: Robin MacPherson
- **Treasurer**: Dean Tedesco
- **Ordinary Committee Members**: Serg Belokamen and Neale Yates

The next year will hopefully be an interesting one. The group is now 2 years old, and started as a bunch of people who met up at a cafe once a month. I first went to one of these meetings in March 2003, and the next month we had our first organised meeting.

We've had regular talks on a range of topics and at different levels, and I hope we can continue with this into the future.

With only two of the six committee members having been in the previous committee, I hope this new blood will help the group flourish and go in directions we hadn't yet dreamed of!
