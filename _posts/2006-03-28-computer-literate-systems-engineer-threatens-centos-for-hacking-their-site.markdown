I just finished reading [this email transcript](http://wwwf.centos.org/127_story.html?storyid=127) between [Jerry A. Taylor](http://www.tuttle-ok.gov/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7BCC5DEFB6-1B2A-4783-A5F8-A92275C95081%7D) of The City of Tuttle and Johnny Hughes of the CentOS development team, and I'm mad on behalf of Johnny. I'm proud of him for being able to remain (outwardly) cool! Nice one Johnny!
