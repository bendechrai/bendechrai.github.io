Most people who know me know that I will find any excuse for a celebration, whether it's a major life event or just the fact that it's a nice evening.

Well today was not only the last day before the Easter break, but also a friend's last day at Sputnik. Most of the office was empty for lunch today as a large contingent went to a nearby pub. We all downed tools at 4.30pm for the Sputnik Social in the kitchen and said our farewells to Tony.

I won't miss him to be honest. I'll see him in under 2 weeks for the inaugural [Melbourne Pool Players](https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_154274537969820 "Facebook Group: Melbourne Pool Players") meetup in town.
