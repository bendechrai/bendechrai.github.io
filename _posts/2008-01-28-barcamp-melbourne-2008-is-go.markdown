[![BarCamp Melbourne 2.0](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/barcamp_melbourne_20_400_100.png)](http://barcampmelbourne.org/)BarCamp Melbourne is on for the 23rd of February 2008 in Melbourne CBD. This will be the first BarCamp held in Melbourne itself, and hopefully this will make it more accessible than last year's (there are rumours that two participants got lost and never made the event!!). While this is a free event, please remember that you must register to attend. Details on the web site.

To remind you, a BarCamp is "an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees", anyone is welcome to come along for free. Everyone is asked to participate by giving a presentation or leading or participating in a discussion, essentially forcing the sharing of ideas and knowledge.
