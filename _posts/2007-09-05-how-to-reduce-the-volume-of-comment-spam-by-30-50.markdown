Richard was kind enough to [offer his assistance](https://bendechrai.com/2006/12/14/solitary-confinement/#comment-2) in reducing comment spam on my site by 30-50%. He obviously doesn't read my blog much, or he'd notice I don't actually have a problem with comment spam, or perhaps he targeted me because a reduction of 30-50% of zero spam is an extremely achievable result. Or perhaps, he's spamming and doesn't even know he's contacted me.

But I have to admit - his technique to help reduce spam is ingenious!

> I know a lot of spammers and I will ask them not to post on your site.

Genius, I tell you. Pure genius!
