The [call for papers](http://osdc.com.au/papers/cfp.html) is now officially out for the [Open Source Developers' Conference](http://osdc.com.au/) 2007. This year is the first non-Melbourne year, with the event being managed by a new organisational committee in Brisbane!

So add the 26th - 29th of November to your diaries, and [get your papers submitted](http://osdc2007.cgpublisher.com/proposals/proposal_entry) by the 30th of June, and I'll see you in Brisbane in 6 months!
