If you're planning on going to the [Open Source Developers' Conference](http://osdc.com.au/) this December, then register soon! Early bird closes this Sunday, so full price tickets apply from Monday ($295 instead of $245).

And if you're presenting, don't forget your final submission has to be in today!

Good luck, and see you there...
