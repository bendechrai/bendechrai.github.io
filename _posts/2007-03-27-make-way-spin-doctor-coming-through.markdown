I can't laugh at this, it's just too expected. But I thought I'd share anyway.

> "\[...\] Microsoft said today that it sold more than 20 million Windows Vista licenses in the first month after the OS's general debut on January 30. This compares to 17 million licenses of XP sold in the first two months after its release." "The Associated Press dug deeper, noting that since XP's release the overall PC market has grown by almost a factor of 2, so it would be a surprise if Vista didn't do twice as well \[...\] Also, Microsoft's 20 million figure includes the backlog of upgrade coupons bundled with XP computers sold since last October."
