[OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/ "Open Web Application Security Project") have recently released their [PHP Top 5](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Top_5) vulnerabilities based on the frequency they are used in attacks. The majority of the causes for these five vulnerabilities are poor input validation, configuration and permission settings.
