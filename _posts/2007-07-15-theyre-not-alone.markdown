I just saw one of those "authorised by the Australian Government, Canberra" type Work Places adverts. The opening line went something along the lines of:

> The biggest myth is that employees are alone and unprotected, but that's just not true. They are not alone!

Read between the lines. Tell me why I laughed! \[Updated quote on July 16th at 11:52\]
