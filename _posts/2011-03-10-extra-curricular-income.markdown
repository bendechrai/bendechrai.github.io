We couldn't be arsed to cook tonight, but Jo made some money on a recent sale, so we had pizza. Yum! Lots of chatting about family, drinking of red wine and eating of sausage, chicken and vegetables on a gluten free base expertly crafted by Domino's.

Life has been quite cruisey recently. Some major news in the brewing, but mostly just freaking awesome.

Now, time for Alias before we sell the TV!
