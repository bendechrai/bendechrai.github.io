[![University of Melbourne](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/unimelb.gif "University of Melbourne")](http://www.dis.unimelb.edu.au/) [Gary](http://www.stroppytux.net/) was going to go and buy last minute items, such as paper, notepads, etc. when Sandrine called to tell me that [Melbourne University's Department of Information Systems](http://www.dis.unimelb.edu.au/) are lending/giving us whatever stationary we need, so we now have butcher paper, notepads, tape, sticky putty for sticking paper to walls, and so forth. [![Huge Object](https://bendechrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/hugeobject.gif "Huge Object")](http://hugeobject.com.au/)In other news, we are now fully sponsored. With [Andrew's](http://ae.hugeobject.com/) help, [Huge Object](http://hugeobject.com.au/) have come in at the last minute and given us some cash, so we can now officially afford the venu and catering! Hooray and thanks!
