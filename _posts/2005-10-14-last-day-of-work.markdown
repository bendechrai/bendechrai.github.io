Today is my last day of work, and I'm kinda excited. There's no break for me though - it's straight to work again on Monday, only now I'm working 10 'til 6, which means I get to sleep in a bit, if my other half lets me.

But as they say, a change is as good as a rest, and this is certainly going to be a change. I'm finally going to start a project that I know I'm going to finish, and be able to do it all the way I want. I'll be able to use all the object oriented PHP knowledge I gained in the last year and produce something worth writing home about. I hope.
