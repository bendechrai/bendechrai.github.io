Maybe you've written a blog in 5 minutes, but what about a secure, encrypted communications application in 3 hours?

This workshop will get you started with a simple Laravel / jQuery application, and iteratively build it up to become an end-to-end encrypted chat platform.

You'll learn how to get started quickly, add encryption layers to the system, design database structures that won't leak metadata, and even provide mechanisms for plausible deniability.

Participants will benefit from having a moderate understanding of a current PHP frameworks, MySQL/MariaDB, and be comfortable understanding JavaScript.
