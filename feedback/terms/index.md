## What constitutes an entry

1. I value **honest feedback** over nice feedback, but insist that you keep it **constructive and kind**.
1. I will not consider any entries that appear to be test data, duplicates, addendums, spam, hatemail, or in any way considered inappropriate.
1. You need to include a **working email address** in the feedback form, where prompted, to be included in the draw.
1. You might have the opportunity to **subscribe to my YouTube channel** for a **second entry** into the draw.

## Second Entry

After you complete the feedback form, you will see a YouTube subscribe link. If you're not already a subscriber, subscribing will give you a second entry into the draw.

To register this second entry, you must subscribe via the button provided on the success page, immediately after submitting the feedback. To the extent that I can detect and correlate this, each entry will receive an extra chance of winning, with a cap of one extra chance per email address.

For example, if you:

* give feedback for one talk and then subscribe to my YouTube channel,
* then give feedback on another talk another month, unsubscribe and resubscribe to my YouTube channel

you will not get a second entry for the second subscription to my YouTube channel.

## Time and date of each draw

I run this reward quarterly. The first round will run from Jan 1st 2020 until March 31st 2020. Each subsequent round will run in the next 3-month period. Given my travel I cannot guarantee my availabilty to draw exactly at the end of each quarter, but will endeavour to do so within one calendar month. I will ensure that the entries are filtered to only include those made during the previous quarter. Any entries made since the start of the next quarter will only be eligible for consideration in the next draw.

## Choice of gift card

I will contact the winner and discuss how to award the gift card. The easiest way would be for me to send you an Amazon gift card, which can be redeemed from anywhere, but if you don't buy from Amazon, then we can work something else out.

## Termination of this reward offer

I reserve the right to terminate this reward offer at any time. At such time, if there have been eligible entries since the last draw, I will endeavour to make good on the prize draw, but reserve the right not to do so.
